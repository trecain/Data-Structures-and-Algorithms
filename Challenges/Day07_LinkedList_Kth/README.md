# Linked List Kth Index from List End

## Challenge 

Given an input and Linked List, return the value of of the node at the inputs position

## Approach and Efficiency

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

I will create a method that will have to search through the link list and return at the value inputed. 
Meaning time will depend on how many nodes are in the Link List.
