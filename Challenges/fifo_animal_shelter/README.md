# FIFO Animal Shelter

## Challenge 

First-in, First out Animal Shelter.

## Approach and Efficiency
```
	Enqueue: 
	Time: O(1) - A node is only added to the rear.
	Space: O(n) - No new nodes created just added.

```

```
	Dequeue: 
	Time: O(n) - Iteration through each node to find the pref so dependent on the amount of nodes in the queue.
	Space: O(1) - Nothing new is created so no new space is allocated. 

```
