# Shift Array

## Challenge 
Inputting an array of integers and single integer, return an array that sets the individual integer in the middle of the array.

## Approach and Efficiency

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

I will create a new array set to the length of the input array plus one to get the correct amount of indices to shift the new integer to.
Then I will iterate through the arrays using a for loop and a count variable to target the correct index in the newly created array.

## Solution
