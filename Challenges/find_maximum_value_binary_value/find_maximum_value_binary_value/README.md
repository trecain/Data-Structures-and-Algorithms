# Maximum Value In A Binary Tree

## Challenge 
Write a function called FindMaximumValue that takes in a binary tree and returns the maximum value in the tree.

## Example
```
	Input of Binary Tree:
	3
	4
	5
	6
	7
	17

	Output:
	17
```
## Approach and Efficiency

- Time: O(n) - Input tree isn't order so we have to check each node for value.
- Space: O(n) - We don't create nodes but traverse them.

## Solution
![find max value in a binary tree]()
