# Linked List Zipper Merge

## Challenge 

Write a method that takes two different linked list and merges the two in a zipper pattern. 
eg. input: 2, 4, 6, 11, 9, 5 output: "2 --> 4 --> 6 --> 11 --> 9 --> 5 --> NULL\n"

## Approach and Efficiency

- Time: O(n) - It's dependant on the amount of Nodes in each of the two linked list.
- Space: O(1) - No new items are created so no new space is needed.  Giving us a space of O(1).
