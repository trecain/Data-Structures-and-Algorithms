# Reversed Linked List

## Challenge 
Write a method that takes in a Linked List and outputs the nodes in the list in reverse order.

## Approach and Efficiency

- Time: O(n)	Traversing the linked list depends on the amount of nodes in the list.
- Space: O(1) We do not create anything new in space.
