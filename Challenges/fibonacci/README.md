# Fibonacci

## Challenge 
Generate nth Fibonacci numbers two different ways. 

## Approach and Efficiency

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

I will be creating a method that takes in a single integer as a parameter and output a number based off the fibonacci sequence.  Ex: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5
I will be doing the implementations Iteratively and Recursively.
