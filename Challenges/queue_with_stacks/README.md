# FIFO Animal Shelter

## Challenge 

Create a queue like animal shelter that will add in an animal.  The animal will either be a dog or a cat that will be added into the animal shelter.  There should be two options.  
One that handles the enqueue and one that handles the dequeue.  If a user wants a dog or a cat, then they should receive the dog that has had the longest stay at the shelter but has to be animal specific.
If neither is specified then just return the animal that has had the longest stay at the shelter.

## Approach and Efficiency
