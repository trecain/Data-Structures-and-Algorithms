# Breadth First Traversal

## Challenge 

Write a breadth first traversal method that takes in a binary tree and traverses the input tree using a Breadth-first approach.

## Approach and Efficiency

- Time: O(n) - Traverses the nodes nothing new gets created.
- Space: O(n) - Space is dependant on the amount of nodes in the tree.
